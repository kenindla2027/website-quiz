    One scorching summer, the desert became dry, and there was no water left for the plants. The rose quickly began to wilt. Her beautiful petals dried up, losing their lush color.
    Looking to the cactus, she saw a sparrow dip his beak into the cactus to drink some water. Though ashamed, the rose asked the cactus if she could have some water. The kind cactus readily agreed, helping them both through the tough summer, as friends.

    And she would toil back with a heavy grain of wheat balanced on her head. She would put the grain of wheat carefully away in her larder, and then hurry back to the field for another one. All day long she would work without stop or rest, scurrying back and forth from the field. She was determined collecting the grains of wheat and storing them carefully in her larder.
    The grasshopper would look at her and laugh. "Why do you work so hard, dear ant?" he would say. "Come, rest a while, listen to my song. Summer is here, the days are long and bright. Why waste the sunshine in labour and toil?" The grasshopper mocked the ant impolitely.`,

    q: `The Hungry Fox

    Once upon a time, there was a hungry fox. He was looking something to eat. He was very, very hungry.
    He explored the entire forest but in vain. Finally, he went to the edge of the forest and started searching for food. Suddenly, he caught sight of a big tree with the hole in it. Inside the hole, there was a package with delicious smell. The hungry fox immediately thought that there might be food in it and became very happy. He jumped into the hole without thinking the later consequences.
    When he opened the package, he saw slices of bread, meat, and other food in it. He was very amazed. His mouth was watering already. The fox went deep inside the tree trunk and began to eat the food. After the fox finished eating the food, he felt very thirsty and decided to leave the hole. He poked out his head out but he was stuck on the stomach. No matter how hard he tried, he could not get out of the hole. The hungry fox had eaten so much food that he became too big to fit through the hole.
    The fox was very sad and upset. He sadly said to himself that he should have thought a little before jumping into the hole. You know that if you are too greedy, you can get trapped as well.`,
